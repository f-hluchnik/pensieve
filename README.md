# Pensieve

The inspiration for Pensieve comes from the magical object owned by Dumbledore in Harry Potterâ€”a basin used to store and revisit memories. While traditional note-taking apps allow thoughts to be saved, I always felt the need for occasional reminders.

That's where this project began. Slack provided the perfect platform, offering seamless bot integration to make revisiting important thoughts effortless.
